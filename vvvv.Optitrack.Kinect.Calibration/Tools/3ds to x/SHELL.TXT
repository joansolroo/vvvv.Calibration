Conv3ds-shell V1.1ue by 'maria' in 1998

This program is freeware.

Use it on your own risc.

In this readme the parameters of conv3ds from the MS DX-SDK are not explained!
You may find help by starting conv3ds.exe at the command-line without any parameters.


USAGE:

After copying shell.exe, shell.mar and conv3ds.exe (optional: convx.exe + convxof.exe)in
the directory - where you want to be your *.x-files in - it should work without problems. 

The 'OPEN-button' loads a *.3ds-file from any folder of your harddisk.
The 'Convert-button' starts conv3ds, whitch will convert the selected *.3ds-file into
a *.x-file and write it into the folder where conv3ds is saved.
- That's all.

If you mark a parameter, shell.exe will send it to conv3ds. 
Down-left you see the command-line. That may help you if you used conv3ds before.

In this version of Conv3ds-shell there are two additional tools for convx and convxof.
The usage is the same like for Conv3ds-shell.

Everybody is allowed to change this *.txt file IF it will make it better!

If you have any questions about Conv3ds-shell (not conv3ds.exe) or any tips to make my
program more comfortable, send it to me at MSchmedicke@online.de.

Attention: Don't push the 'About-button' when you haven't installed DirectX allready,
            because it uses D3D!

	
In hope that my program will help you,
